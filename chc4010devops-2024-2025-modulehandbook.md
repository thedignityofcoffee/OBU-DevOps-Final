# Module Introduction  

# Module Leader’s Introduction  

This module aims to equip students with the essential knowledge and skills required for using professional tools for software development, which is fundamental to all programmes for which this module is compulsory. Students will be taught how to use the features of the most common Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) to write, debug, document and test the computer programs they develop. Students will also be introduced to the use of version control software to manage to programme code updates.  

The module is taught in three hours of practical classes and workshop weekly. There will be one coursework tasks during the semester due at the end of the module and a written examination at the end of the module.

# Generative Artificial Intelligence Usage Policy for Chengdu University of Technology Oxford Brookes College Computing Programmes.  

# Overview  

Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools have been in the news recently, particularly ChatGPT. Here, we discuss the possibilities and limitations of such tools and consider how to use them responsibly and ethically.  While we provide the basic information here, all students taking any Software Engineering or Computer Science modules are strongly encouraged to read through the Oxford Brookes University AI usage policy, which will give you a more detailed insight into how AI can be used appropriately. Refer to the links below on Brookes AI guidance policy and approach:  

AI Guidance Policy: https://www.brookes.ac.uk/students/academicdevelopment/online-resources/artificial-intelligence   
AI Approach at Brookes: https://www.brookes.ac.uk/students/academicdevelopment/our-approach-to-ai  

# AI can provide learning opportunities  

Large Language Model Tools (such as ChatGPT and QuillBot) are a range of artificial intelligence tools that can enhance learning if used cautiously, critically, and reflectively. If you provide clear and accurate prompts to ChatGPT, you will likely get relevant and appropriate responses for your needs. When used responsibly in this way, ChatGPT can support your learning, your research, and your writing, and ensure that the ideas and arguments presented in your assignments reflect your understanding of the subject.  

# AI Has Limitations  

Be mindful that ChatGPT merely searches for the quickest answers to your questions and collates them for you. By searching for quick (and potentially unreliable or false) answers, you may miss out on the opportunity to develop the critical research and thinking skills that are key to learning at university and making informed decisions generally. Make sure that you understand the limitations of ChatGPT and take steps to verify any information before using it in your work. Output from ChatGPT may contain falsified or misrepresented references, which should not be used in your work. Use genuine, traceable data and sources of information to verify its responses. Take the time to review and critically evaluate the responses generated by ChatGPT, and only use information that is accurate, relevant, and well-supported. Be aware of the potential for bias in texts produced by AI models, including ChatGPT, and take steps to mitigate this in your work. A crucial part of writing at university is learning to develop your own authorial voice. Using AI tools to generate text can take this opportunity away and remove ‘you’ from your work.  

# AI can be used under the following conditions  

Students must seek guidance from the module leader on the ethical use of AI tools in their module assignments and research. Students must use the form on the students' website to declare which AI tools they have used and how they have used them. Next, paste a copy of your completed declaration form into an appendix section at the end of your deliverable such as your module assignment write-up.  

# Use AI with CAUTION (a useful acronym):  

Check your prompts. The information you get out is only as good as the requests you put in.  

Approach any information the AI tool produces cautiously (be a critical reader).  

Understand that Large Language Models (including ChatGPT) are designed only to summarise, predict, and generate texts. They won’t think for you.  

Take the time to verify any claims made and check the reliability of any sources.  

Identify any use of AI tools (including large language models such as Chat GPT) in the student declaration form (below). Always declare your use of AI tools and explain how you used them.  

Observe the principles of Good Academic Practice at all times.  

Never submit chunks of text produced by AI as your own work. You may be in breach of the academic conduct regulations.  

# Make safe choices when choosing AI software  

AI models and software tools might save you time and help you to think differently but they might also store, use, or distribute data uploaded to them. This means they are not necessarily safe and secure. Therefore, when using AI tools, beware of uploading any sensitive, confidential, or protected data and ask yourself these guiding questions:  

Do I fully understand the data protection and privacy settings on this AI tool?   
What data, in my prompts and in what I upload, am I giving them?   
Do I have the right to give it to them, is it my information and not someone else's?   
Am I happy for them to store, use, and share this data with others?   
Will sharing this data lead to harm or impact on mine or someone's freedoms   
and rights?  

# Consequences of using AI  

Remember that AI tools should not be used to replace you as the author of your work. If you gain an unfair advantage using AI tools, you may breach the CDUT-OBU academic conduct regulations.  

# Late Submission of Work/Non-attendance at Exams  

Students who submit work late, or do not attend an examination, will receive a mark of ZERO for that element of assessment.  

If mitigating circumstances (for example, medical or personal circumstances) affect your ability to meet an assessment deadline or attend an examination then it is ESSENTIAL that you notify your module leader and submit a Mitigating Circumstances Request form as soon as possible and in any case BEFORE an assessment deadline or the start of an examination. You will be required to provide satisfactory documentary evidence to support your claim. The only exception to this is for very short extensions (up to one week) to an assessment deadline, where you may be allowed to self-certify your difficulties if there is a valid reason why you cannot provide evidence.  

If you submit a claim of mitigating circumstances later than an assessment deadline or the start of an examination, then you will not only need to demonstrate that you were affected by these circumstances but you will also need to provide evidence that you were unable to submit your claim by the deadline.  

For further details of the University’s regulations for the consideration of exceptional circumstances please see:  

https://www.brookes.ac.uk/students/your-studies/exceptional-circumstances/  

Late submission regulations apply to both hard copy (paper) and electronic submissions, including electronic submissions to Turnitin where relevant.  

# Minimum Mark Rule  

You must score a minimum of $40 \%$ overall to pass the module.  

# Technical Failure  

You must score a minimum of $30 \%$ on the final exam to pass the module. Failure to do so will be considered a technical failure.  

# Authenticating Your Coursework  

You must be able to demonstrate that the course work you submit for assessment is your own. You must therefore keep all working documents (electronic and paper) that you used or created while preparing the assignment, such as photocopies of sources and internet pages, your own notes on your reading and preparation and where primary research has been conducted, completed questionnaires or interview schedules, details of the process of analysis, field notes and so on. Most importantly, you should keep the early developing drafts of your coursework as evidence of the originality of your work by saving each revision to a file with a different name. This material should be kept until after the module results have been published on PIP. Please note that you may be required to submit an electronic version of your work.  

# Guidelines on Using Others to Check Your Work  

If you are not too confident in the accuracy of your written English, you may want to ask someone to help you by checking your work. However, it is important that this is not done in such a way that you are committing academic misconduct, which could result in disciplinary action. University guidance can be found at:  

https://www.brookes.ac.uk/documents/students/research-degrees/e21-proofreadingguidance/  

# University Regulation A3-13 Cheating  

All assessments are intended to determine the skills, abilities, understanding and knowledge of each of the individual students undertaking the assessment. Cheating is defined as conduct (whether successful or not) aimed at deceiving the University into acknowledging a false level of attainment by a student. Cheating including assisting someone else to cheat (including attempting to assist someone else to cheat) may be subject to disciplinary action in accordance with the University's Disciplinary Procedure. The University takes this issue very seriously and students have been expelled or had their degrees withheld for cheating in assessments.  It is important that students having difficulties with their work should seek help from their tutors rather than be tempted to use unfair means to gain marks.  Students should not risk losing their degree and undermining all the work they have done towards it.  

Any form of cheating is strictly forbidden under this regulation but, in order to assist understanding, a number of specific forms of cheating are described.  These include but are not limited to the following examples:  

Submitting other people's work as your own – either with or without their knowledge. This includes copying in examinations; using notes or unauthorised materials in examinations; submitting work you have paid for as your own; impersonation – taking an assessment on behalf of or pretending to be another student, or allowing another person to take an assessment on your behalf or pretend to be you.  

 Plagiarism – taking or using another person's thoughts, writings or inventions as your own. To avoid plagiarism you must make sure that quotations from whatever source are clearly identified and attributed at the point where they occur in the text of your work by using one of the standard conventions for referencing.  The Library has a leaflet about how to reference your work correctly and your tutor can also help you.  It is not enough just to list sources in a bibliography at the end of your essay or dissertation if you do not acknowledge the actual quotations in the text. Neither is it acceptable to change some of the words or the order of sentences if, by failing to acknowledge the source properly, you give the impression that it is your own work.  

 Collusion – except where written instructions specify that work for assessment may be produced jointly and submitted as the work of more than one student, you must not collude with others to produce a piece of work jointly, copy or share another student's work or lend your work to another student when it is likely that some or all of it will be copied.  

 Duplication – submitting work for assessment that is the same as, or broadly similar to, work submitted earlier for academic credit, without acknowledgement of the previous submission.  

Falsification – the invention of data, its alteration, its copying from any other source, or otherwise obtaining it by unfair means, or inventing quotations and/or references.  

 Custom writing services – this includes the use of any service which produces custom materials. The University may consider any request placed with any form of custom writing service to be a form of cheating, whatever use is then made of the material produced, and therefore to be an offence under the Student Conduct Regulations.  This extends to include any request for any piece of work (either formative or summative assessment or work which is not linked to any form of assessment or credit-bearing element of your programme) including, but not limited to, essays and dissertations (including outlines and guides), reports, exam notes, proposals, posters, presentations, the editing or improvement of existing work, statistical services and computing services including programme and code development.  

 Assisting others to cheat - The University considers assisting others to cheat (including attempting to assist someone else to cheat) as a form of cheating for which the individual student providing assistance is culpable.
