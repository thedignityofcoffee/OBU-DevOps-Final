# CHC4010 DevOps Week 11 Practical: Deployment
## Part I. Drawing with turtle-logo  

1. Create a new project in IntelliJ with Maven build and add [turtle-logo](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/org.gannacademy.cdf/turtle-logo) to project dependencies.  
2. Read the [documentation](https://gann-cdf.github.io/turtle-logo/) of turtle-logo. Add the sample program to your project and run it.  
3. Initialize a new `AnimatedTurtle` and draw any shape you want with it. You can be as creative as you want.  

## Part II. Deploy to a JAR file  

1. Follow the instruction in lecture slides and deploy your program to a standalone JAR. Make sure the package used is included in the JAR.  
2. Send the JAR file to a classmate. Check if it runs correctly on their computer. If not, figure out why.
